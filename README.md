# GameEngine_Assignment
An assignment that sets out to create a customisable world generation tool. 

## Introduction
In this project I aim to create a procedurally generated 3d terrain. This means procedurally generating the mesh and everything to with it.

## The Goal
The Goal of the project is to create a procedurally generated world that can be easily edited and changed from the unity editor. I plan on being able to control how mountainous the level is, whether its an island or not, the colours of the different Biomes ect.

The procedural terrain will be created using Perlin noise at different derrivatives to achive a natural looking landscape.
